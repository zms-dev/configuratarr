  Procedure + reference for adding a resource to an existing service crate in configuratarr
  (e.g. a new Radarr resource, or a resource in a sibling *arr crate). Covers the three

# Adding a Resource

For a resource **in an *arr crate** (radarr/sonarr/lidarr/prowlarr/whisparr/readarr), mirror `crates/radarr-v3/` exactly — it is the canonical template, every decision there was deliberate, do not invent alternatives. For a resource in a **non-*arr crate** (jellyfin, overseerr, autobrr, bazarr), radarr's *archetypes and codecs* (collection / singleton / provider-fields-blob) are **not guaranteed to apply** — that API may have a different auth/path/codec shape and no provider concept. Don't assume; first know the engine.

> **Required before modeling a resource whose shape you're unsure of:** load the **`core-architecture`** skill and read `crates/core` (`descriptor.rs`, `codec/`, `field.rs`, `service.rs`) + the macro args in `core-macros`. The archetype/attribute tables below are the *common* instantiations of that engine, not its limits. The engine — the four axes (endpoints / codec / sync / auth) and the codec set — is what tells you which shape a given resource needs.

## 0. Inspect the spec first

Use the `openapi-tools` skill before writing any struct: `list_paths` to confirm the endpoint (→ `sync` kind + paths), `get_resource` for the full field list + which fields are `readOnly`/nullable/defaulted. These read the spec only — you write the struct by hand in the macro form (next sections).

## 1. Pick the archetype

| Archetype | When | `sync` |
|---|---|---|
| **Collection** | named, CRUD (tags, profiles) | `crud` |
| **Singleton** | one object, no key (config/*) | `singleton` |
| **Provider** | dynamic `fields[]` blob (download clients, indexers, notifications, import lists) | `crud` + composition |

## 2. The codec is selected by *which macro* you use

| Macro | CodecKind | For |
|---|---|---|
| `#[resource(...)]` | Standard | flat JSON (camelCase wire keys) |
| `#[fields_blob(...)]` | FieldsBlob | provider variant configs (`fields:[{name,value}]`) |
| `#[tagged(by = "...")]` | TaggedByImpl | discriminator-dispatched provider enum |
| `#[wire_enum(rename_all = "...")]` | StringEnum | unit enum → bare string |
| `#[nested]` | Standard, Embedded | shared sub-struct hoisted via `#[flatten]` |

**Macro ordering gotcha:** the resource macro is the **outermost** attribute; field helper attrs (`#[id]`, `#[key]`, `#[wire(...)]`, …) sit **below** it, or they leak through unstripped and rustc rejects them.

## 3. Archetype shapes

### Collection — `tag.rs`
```rust
#[resource(
    sync = crud,
    list   = get("/api/v3/tag"),
    create = post("/api/v3/tag"),
    update = put("/api/v3/tag/${self.id}"),
    delete = delete("/api/v3/tag/${self.id}"),
)]
pub struct Tag {
    #[id]  pub id: Option<i32>,
    #[key] pub label: String,        // natural key — ${ref.tag.<label>}
}
```

### Singleton — `ui_config.rs`
```rust
#[resource(
    sync = singleton,
    read   = get("/api/v3/config/ui"),
    update = put("/api/v3/config/ui/${self.id}"),   // write path is /{id}
)]
pub struct UiConfig {
    #[id] pub id: Option<i32>,
    pub first_day_of_week: i32,
    pub theme: Option<String>,
}
```

### Provider — three composed pieces

**Envelope** (`provider.rs`, shared) — `#[nested]` struct with identity + tag refs + read-only metadata:
```rust
#[nested]
pub struct Provider {
    #[id]  pub id: Option<i32>,
    #[key] pub name: String,
    #[reference(tag)] pub tags: Vec<i32>,
    #[wire(name = "implementationName", read_only)] pub implementation_name: Option<String>,
    #[wire(read_only)] pub message: Option<ProviderMessage>,
    #[wire(read_only)] pub presets: Vec<Json>,
}
```

**Outer resource** (`download_client.rs`) — flattens envelope + typed config, adds its own fields:
```rust
#[resource(sync = crud, list = get("/api/v3/downloadclient"), create = post(...), update = put(".../${self.id}"), delete = delete(".../${self.id}"))]
pub struct DownloadClient {
    #[flatten] pub common: Provider,
    #[flatten] pub config: DownloadClientProvider,
    pub enable: bool,
    pub protocol: DownloadProtocol,
    #[default(1)] pub priority: i32,
}
```

**Tagged enum** (`download_clients/mod.rs`) — one `#[variant("<Impl>")]` per implementation, `#[fallback]` preserves unmodelled impls via `RawProvider`:
```rust
#[tagged(by = "implementation")]
pub enum DownloadClientProvider {
    #[variant("QBittorrent")] QBittorrent(QBittorrentConfig),
    // ... one per impl, one file each under download_clients/
    #[fallback] Unknown(RawProvider),
}
```

**Variant** (`download_clients/qbittorrent.rs`) — each typed field → one `{name,value}` blob entry:
```rust
#[fields_blob(implementation = "QBittorrent", config_contract = "QBittorrentSettings", protocol = "torrent")]
pub struct QBittorrentConfig {
    pub host: Option<String>,
    pub password: Option<SecretValue>,                    // credential — redacted
    #[wire(name = "useSsl")] pub use_ssl: Option<bool>,   // override irregular API casing
}
```

### Where the provider variant list + `fields[]` come from (the OpenAPI spec does NOT have them)

The static spec types `fields` as a generic `[{name, value}]` array — it tells you **nothing** about which implementations exist or what fields each one has. Two sources fill that gap:

1. **Live `/schema` endpoint** (e2e shell) — ground truth, but needs a running server.
2. **The devopsarr terraform provider for this app** — the best *offline* source. `specs/terraform_providers.txt` lists the repos (read it — it grows). Map `terraform-provider-<app>` ↔ `<app>-vN` (e.g. `sonarr-v3` → `terraform-provider-sonarr`). Clone shallow **into scratch** (never the repo): `git clone --depth 1 <url> <scratch>/...`. Then under `internal/provider/`:
   - **`<resource>_<impl>_resource.go` filenames = the variant list** (e.g. every `download_client_*_resource.go` → one `#[variant(...)]`). This is what you copy into the `#[tagged]` enum + one file each.
   - Inside a file: the `...Implementation` const → `#[fields_blob(implementation = "...")]`; the `...ConfigContract` const → `config_contract = "..."`; the model struct's `` `tfsdk:"..."` `` tags → the snake_case field names; Go types (`types.String/Int64/Bool`) → field types; **`Sensitive: true` on an attribute → `SecretValue`**.

**Authority + the trap this closes:** the tf provider can lag the live API, so `/schema` wins on conflict — but it is right about the *shape*, and it is **per-app**. Sonarr's Transmission has `tv_category`/`tv_directory`/`recent_tv_priority`; Radarr's has `movieCategory`/`movieDirectory`/`recentMoviePriority`. Cloning radarr's variant and renaming the struct silently ships movie fields to a series API — checking the matching app's provider is how you avoid it. When in doubt about *any* provider variant or field, consult this list before guessing.

## 4. Field attribute reference

| Situation | Attribute |
|---|---|
| Server-assigned id (read-only on write) | `#[id]` |
| Natural key (`${ref.<type>.<key>}` + diff key) | `#[key]` |
| FK to another resource by name | `#[reference(<type>)]` on `i32` / `Option<i32>` / `Vec<i32>` |
| Wire name ≠ snake→camel | `#[wire(name = "...")]` |
| Present on read, never sent | `#[wire(read_only)]` |
| Emit a `None` optional as explicit `null` (not omitted) | `#[wire(null)]` |
| Encode a `bool` as the int `0`/`1` (and decode back) | `#[wire(int)]` |
| Nested struct hoisted to parent keys | `#[flatten]` |
| Non-zero default for an absent config key | `#[default(expr)]` |
| Open `name: value` settings map ↔ *arr `fields:[{name,value}]` blob | `#[fields_map]` on a `Json` field |
| Credential | field type `SecretValue` (no attribute — inferred) |

`#[fields_map]` is for an **open / dynamically-keyed** provider blob whose settings can't be a fixed struct (e.g. Prowlarr indexers — Cardigann definitions vary per tracker). The user authors a plain YAML map (`fields: { baseUrl: ..., apiKey: ... }`); the standard wire codec splays it to `fields:[{name,value}]` on encode and collects it back on decode. `${env}`/`${ref}` resolve inside the values; the whole map redacts as `Complex` in plan output. Used by `raw_provider.rs` (`RawProvider`). For a **closed** variant set, use typed `#[fields_blob]` variants instead — only reach for `#[fields_map]` when the key set is genuinely open.

`#[wire(null)]` and `#[wire(int)]` (standard codec only) exist so a hand-rolled `sync = custom` translator doesn't have to. Reach for them when the API's read shape needs a `None` optional present as an explicit `null` (so a whole-object diff stays structural) or stores a boolean as an int — e.g. bazarr's `LanguageProfile` (`#[wire(null, int)]` on `original_format`) and `Notifier` (`#[wire(null)]` on `url`). They compose (`#[wire(null, int)]`), so a custom reconcile can just `engine::encode(&decode_config::<T>(v)?)` instead of poking `serde_json::Value` field-by-field. Mixed casing within one document is handled by giving a nested child struct its own `case = ...` — not a field attribute.

Endpoints are **always explicit** (`verb("/path")`); paths may carry `${self.<field>}` (resolved against the live/merged value at apply, e.g. `/api/v3/tag/${self.id}`).

## 5. Wire it in

1. `pub mod <resource>;` in `src/resources/mod.rs`.
2. Add the field to the `#[service]` struct (`Vec<R>` = collection, `Option<R>` = singleton).
3. Add a `tests/testdata/<resource>/config.yaml` fixture (realistic snake_case user config; may use `${ref}` / `${env}`). **Cover every non-scalar field** — `Option<Nested>`, `Vec<Nested>`, nested objects — not just the scalar happy path. A field the fixture omits is a field no test exercises: that's exactly how `quality_profile.items` (a `Vec<Nested>`) silently encoded as `[]` for ages. (You don't need to include read-only fields — they're never written.)
4. Add one line to `tests/spec_conformance.rs`:
   `conformance!(<name>, resources::<r>::<Type>, "<SchemaName>Resource", "testdata/<r>/config.yaml");`
5. Add a `///` doc comment to the struct + each field (feeds `config-doc-gen`).

## 6. Verify

```bash
nix develop --command cargo nextest run -p <crate> --test spec_conformance   # wire shape vs OpenAPI schema
nix develop --command cargo run -q -p config-doc-gen                  # regenerate docs
```
Conformance validates the encoded payload against the spec schema (`additionalProperties: false` catches mis-casing / hallucinated / mis-typed fields) **and** checks the codec round-trips (decode→encode is byte-stable — catches a field that decodes but doesn't re-encode, which schema validation alone misses since a dropped array still validates as an array). Both only fire on fields the fixture actually includes — hence the "cover every non-scalar field" rule above. For lifecycle/FK behavior, add an e2e case (see the `add-service` skill's e2e section).
