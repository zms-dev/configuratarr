# Shell helpers shared by every e2e dev shell.
#
# Two failure modes these exist to kill:
#
# 1. **Leaked instances.** Each shell traps EXIT to stop its service, but under
#    `nix develop .#e2e-<svc> --command …` the trap does not reliably fire, so
#    the service outlives the run and keeps holding its port. The next run's
#    service then dies at bind time ("Aborted (core dumped)") while the health
#    probe happily answers from the *stale* instance — so the suite silently
#    tests a server nobody configured, and results swing between runs depending
#    on what was left behind. `e2e_reclaim_port` makes each run start from a
#    known-clean port.
#
# 2. **Silent onboarding failures.** The hooks drive setup wizards with
#    `curl -sf … > /dev/null`; when a step fails the pipeline still "succeeds"
#    and the exported key ends up empty. An empty key is not obviously broken —
#    some endpoints answer unauthenticated — so the shell announces "ready" and
#    the suite fails later with a confusing 401. `e2e_require` and
#    `e2e_retry` turn those into loud, immediate failures.
