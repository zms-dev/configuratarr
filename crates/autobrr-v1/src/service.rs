//! The Autobrr v1 service. One `#[service]` struct carries the connection fields
//! plus every managed resource.
//!
//! Auth: `X-API-Token` header. Health is checked against `/api/config` — an
//! authenticated JSON endpoint whose GET is read-only (so a healthy response also
//! confirms the token; the `/api/healthz/*` probes return plain text, which the
//! JSON client can't parse). autobrr's app config itself isn't managed here — it
//! writes `config.toml`, read-only under the NixOS module.
