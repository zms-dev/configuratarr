//! Authors — keyed by author name.
//!
//! `getIndex` lists authors (each with `AuthorName` + a server-assigned
//! `AuthorID`); `addAuthor&name=<name>` adds one by name. LazyLibrarian exposes no
//! author update and no `Change`-expressible delete, so this is a `sync = custom`
//! **create-or-leave** resource ([`core_lib::reconcile::create_only`]), matched on
//! `AuthorName` — the "don't remove what you didn't make" caution.
//!
//! Adding by explicit `AuthorID` (`addAuthorID`) and pruning are intentionally not
//! modelled: identity here is the human-facing name, and removal of library
//! content is out of scope (mirrors the other create-only resources).
