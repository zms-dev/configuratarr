//! Bazarr v1 resources.
//!
//! Bazarr has no per-resource CRUD config surface: its entire configuration is
//! one endpoint (`/api/system/settings`) with a form-encoded write. So there is
//! a single `sync = custom` singleton, [`settings::Settings`], composed of typed
//! per-section sub-structs (one module each) plus language profiles.
//!
//! The section sub-structs document the schema (config docs are generated from
//! their `///` comments and field types) and give users a validated shape. Each
//! is a **curated** view — the connection- and behaviour-relevant keys, not every
//! dynaconf validator (runtime/UI-only keys like `theme`, `page_size`, `debug`
//! are omitted). Field names, types and section names mirror bazarr's
//! `app/config.py` validators exactly (the form key is `settings-<section>-<field>`).
//! Every field is `Option`/`Vec`: presence = "manage this key", absence = "leave
//! bazarr's current value untouched" (sparse update).
